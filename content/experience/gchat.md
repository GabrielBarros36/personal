gchat is a real-time chat platform.

You can access the source code [here](https://github.com/GabrielBarros36/gchat) and use it [here](https://www.gchat.cloud/).

Its backend is written in Rust, with:
- Tokio for async support
- Axum for REST APIs
- Websockets for all chat functionalities

Its frontend is built in Typescript with Next.js.

gchat is deployed on a Digital Ocean droplet, with self-hosted PostgreSQL as a database and Nginx as a reverse proxy.
