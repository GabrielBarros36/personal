In the summer of 2025, I was a Software Engineer Intern in the Video Algorithms Systems team at Netflix. 

I worked on Lenny, a research tool to generate bitrate ladders for Netflix's live events. My intern project consisted of migrating Lenny away from a deprecated service, improving robustness to take the tool closer to production-grade, and many usability improvements to let researchers focus on their work rather than on their tools.

I worked mainly with Java/SpringBoot/Groovy and Python. I used also Spinnaker to deploy my project.
