I'm a Software Engineer Intern in the Video Algorithms Systems team at Netflix. 

I work on a research tool to generate bitrate ladders for live events. My intern project consists of migrating it away from a deprecated service, improving robustness to take the tool closer to production-grade, and many usability improvements to let researchers focus on their work rather than on their tools.

I work with Java/SpringBoot/Groovy and Python.
