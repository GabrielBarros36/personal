Since August 2022, I've been an undergrad at [Florida State University](https://www.fsu.edu/) studying CS and Math.

### Consulting

In my freshman year I was an international competitor at FSU's [Case Competition Club](https://www.linkedin.com/company/fsu-case-competition-club/about/). I represented FSU at the [Scotiabank International Case Competition](https://www.ivey-sicc.com/) hosted by [Ivey Business School](https://www.ivey.uwo.ca/), along with [Pedro](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pedromartinsaffonso/), [Bruno](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brunobdelnero/), and [Cole](https://www.linkedin.com/in/coleclemons/). 


### Academics

I like the CS + Math combo because it provides me with a rigorous foundation at the logical and engineering levels - the rest, I am more comfortable learning outside of classes.
