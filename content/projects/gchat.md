gchat is a real-time chat platform built with Rust and NextJS.

It uses [gauth](https://github.com/GabrielBarros36/gauth), my (non-prod!) auth library.

Its backend is written in Rust, with:
- Tokio for async support
- Axum for all API endpoints
- Websockets for all live chat functionalities
- Postgres for user management and message storage
- NextJS for frontend, hosted in Vercel
- DigitalOcean as a VPS
