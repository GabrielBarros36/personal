I've been an avid reader since I was a kid, and I found much of my favorite literature through others' suggestions. I hope I can add value to readers in a similar fashion by listing some of my favorite reads in no particular order. 

- The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt, by Edmund Morris
- Thinking Fast and Slow, by Daniel Kahneman
- The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian, by Sherman Alexie
- Animal Farm, by George Orwell
- [Paul Graham's Essays](https://paulgraham.com/articles.html)
- I,Robot, by Isaac Asimov
