I'm a sophomore at Florida State University, where I study Computer Science and Applied Math. I am interested in distributed and low-latency sytems.

### Currently

- I am an incoming Software Engineering intern at Walmart Global Tech in Sunnyvale, CA.
- I am the director 

### Previously

I worked as an SWE Intern at [Mills](https://www.mills.com.br/), a construction equipment rental company located in my home country, Brazil. I helped train and build infrastructure for a Computer Vision model used to identify damage in construction machinery.

I was the VP of the world's largest DECA Chapter at Cypress Bay High. In addition to directly managing 120 club officers I also competed for our chapter, achieving 9th place at [ICDC](https://www.deca.org/conferences/icdc) in the Business Finance category.

### Broadly

In my free time I enjoy reading, working out, and spending time with my friends.

My favorite hobby, when time allows, is making road trips. I once drove from Florida to California, as well as from Toronto to Maine. Through road trips I get to better know the world, my travel companions, and myself. I want to expand my passion for traveling to the international realm during the rest of my college career - and I'm always open to suggestions!
