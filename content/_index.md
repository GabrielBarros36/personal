- SWE Intern at Turso (Fall 2024)
- Past SWE Intern at Walmart Global Tech working on the Spark Driver app (stress testing infrastructure + unit test coverage)

### Previously

During the summer of 2023 I worked as an SWE Intern at [Mills](https://www.mills.com.br/), a Brazilian construction equipment rental company. I helped train and build infrastructure for a CV model used to identify damage in construction machinery.

During my freshman year I was an international competitor at FSU's [Case Competition Club](https://www.linkedin.com/company/fsu-case-competition-club/about/). I represented FSU at the [Scotiabank International Case Competition](https://www.ivey-sicc.com/) hosted by [Ivey Business School](https://www.ivey.uwo.ca/), along with [Pedro](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pedromartinsaffonso/), [Bruno](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brunobdelnero/), and [Cole](https://www.linkedin.com/in/coleclemons/). 

### Broadly

My favorite hobby is going on road trips and traveling in general. I've driven from Florida to California, as well as from Toronto to Maine. This year I've also traveled through Paris, the Netherlands, and Germany. I want to expand my passion for traveling to Africa and Asia this year - and I'm always open to suggestions!
