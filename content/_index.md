### Currently
- Junior at Florida State studying Math and CS
- Working on [gchat](https://gabe.build/experience/gchat/) and [gauth](https://github.com/GabrielBarros36/gauth)
- Looking for interesting things to work on - if you have any ideas please reach out!

My most recent interest is Rust. Things I plan on exploring soon include Haskell/applied Category Theory, FPGAs, and Reinforcement Learning (especially with GRPO).

### Previously

I've been a SWE intern at [Walmart](https://gabe.build/experience/walmart/) and [Mills](https://gabe.build/experience/mills/).

### Broadly

My favorite hobby is going on road trips and traveling in general. I've driven from Florida to California, as well as from Toronto to Maine. Last year I also traveled through Paris, the Netherlands, and Germany. I want to expand my passion for traveling to Africa and Asia this year - and I'm always open to suggestions!
