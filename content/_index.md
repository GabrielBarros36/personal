I want to make the world more secure, transparent, and safe. I'm a student at Stanford, where I study Symbolic Systems and Computer Science.

### Currently

- I run [Atlos](https://atlos.org), a platform for human rights investigations at scale. Though our partnership with Bellingcat, Atlos powers one of the [largest public investigations](https://ukraine.bellingcat.com) into civilian harm in Ukraine.
- I [maintain](https://github.com/milesmcc) several open source projects, including [Shynet](https://github.com/milesmcc/shynet), [a17t](https://github.com/milesmcc/a17t), and [PrivacySpy](https://privacyspy.org).

### Previously

I've worked on election security at [CISA/DHS](https://cisa.gov), privacy engineering at [Apple](/portfolio/apple), trust and safety at the [Stanford Internet Observatory](https://io.stanford.edu), cyber policy for a [2020 presidential campaign](/portfolio/politics), tech policy with the [Cornell Tech Policy Institute](https://tpi.as.cornell.edu), and digital infrastructure with some [newsrooms](https://newscatalyst.org/).

### Broadly

My projects, research, and commentary have appeared in several outlets including the _New York Times_, the _Washington Post_, _NBC News_, _TIME_, _Foreign Affairs_, Brookings _TechStream_, the _Nightly News_ with Lester Holt, and elsewhere.

I'm an alum of the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/scout/click?t=e62336f0f378bcf03a96d441d015db88), I've co-authored some [papers](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lrKeJiUAAAAJ), I have an [app](https://paxo.ai), and I teach [CS 106S](https://cs106s.stanford.edu). I've enjoyed [good music](https://mottlane.com), [good trouble](https://stanforddaily.com/2022/11/01/opinion-fizz-previously-compromised-its-users-privacy-it-may-do-so-again/), and [good design](https://a17t.miles.land). I am a 2023 National Geographic [Young Explorer](https://blog.nationalgeographic.org/2023/05/02/introducing-the-national-geographic-societys-2023-young-explorers/).
