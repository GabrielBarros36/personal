### Currently
- Junior at Florida State studying Math and CS
- Working on [gchat](https://gabe.build/experience/gchat/) and [gauth](https://github.com/GabrielBarros36/gauth)
- Looking for interesting things to work on - if you have any ideas please reach out!

My most recent interest is Rust. Things I plan on exploring soon include Haskell/applied Category Theory, FPGAs, and Reinforcement Learning (especially with GRPO).
