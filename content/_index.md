I'm a sophomore at Florida State studying Computer Science and Applied Math. 

### Currently

I'm an intern at Walmart Global Tech doing backend work for the Spark Driver app, Walmart's version of Instacart. It's my first time in SV. I'm also a remote intern at Turso, where my project is to build a Java/Spring driver for libSQL, Turso's fork of SQLite.

### Previously

During my freshman summer I worked as an SWE Intern at [Mills](https://www.mills.com.br/), a construction equipment rental company located in my home country, Brazil. I helped train and build infrastructure for a Computer Vision model used to identify damage in construction machinery.

During my freshman year I was an international competitor at FSU's [Case Competition Club](https://www.linkedin.com/company/fsu-case-competition-club/about/). I represented FSU at the [Scotiabank International Case Competition](https://www.ivey-sicc.com/) hosted by [Ivey Business School](https://www.ivey.uwo.ca/), along with [Pedro](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pedromartinsaffonso/), [Bruno](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brunobdelnero/), and [Cole](https://www.linkedin.com/in/coleclemons/). I treasure that opportunity for cultural and intellectual exchange with students from around the world, and I'd encourage anyone to pursue an equivalent opportunity in their field of interest during their college career.

### Broadly

My favorite hobby is going on road trips and traveling in general. I've driven from Florida to California, as well as from Toronto to Maine. Recently I've also traveled through Paris, the Netherlands, and Germany. Through traveling I get to better know the world, my friends, and myself. I want to expand my passion for traveling to Africa and Asia this year - and I'm always open to suggestions!
