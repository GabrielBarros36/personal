I'm a sophomore at Florida State University, where I study Computer Science and Applied Math. I am interested in distributed and low-latency systems.

### Currently

- I am an incoming Software Engineering intern at Walmart Global Tech in Sunnyvale, CA.

### Previously

During my freshman summer I worked as an SWE Intern at [Mills](https://www.mills.com.br/), a construction equipment rental company located in my home country, Brazil. I helped train and build infrastructure for a Computer Vision model used to identify damage in construction machinery.

During my freshman year I was an officer and international competitor at FSU's [Case Competition Club](https://www.linkedin.com/company/fsu-case-competition-club/about/). I represented FSU at the [Scotiabank International Case Competition](https://www.ivey-sicc.com/) hosted by [Ivey Business School](https://www.ivey.uwo.ca/), along with [Pedro](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pedromartinsaffonso/), [Bruno](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brunobdelnero/), and [Cole](https://www.linkedin.com/in/coleclemons/). I treasure this amazing opportunity for cultural and intellectual exchange with students from Asia, Europe, and Latin America, even though my team didn't make it to finals. I'd encourage anyone to pursue an equivalent opportunity in their field of interest during their college career.

### Broadly

In my free time I enjoy reading, working out, and spending time with my friends.

My favorite hobby, is going road trips. I once drove from Florida to California, as well as from Toronto to Maine. Through road trips I get to better know the world, my travel companions, and myself. I want to expand my passion for traveling to the international realm during the rest of my college career - and I'm always open to suggestions!
