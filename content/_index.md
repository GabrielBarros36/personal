### Currently
- Junior at Florida State studying Math and CS
- Right now I'm working on [gchat](https://gabe.build/portfolio/gchat/) and [gauth](https://github.com/GabrielBarros36/gauth)
- Looking for interesting things to work on before my internship starts in June - if you have any ideas please reach out!

My current interests are Rust and the design of streaming pipelines. Things I plan on exploring soon include Haskell/applied Category Theory, FPGAs, and Reinforcement Learning (especially with GRPO).

### Previously

In the summer of 2024 I interned at Walmart Global Tech in the Spark Driver App team (Walmart's version of Doordash). I worked exclusively on backend - my time was spent making unit tests creating some APIs for internal use, and doing some tasks on the team's backlog.

During the summer of 2023 I worked as an SWE Intern at [Mills](https://www.mills.com.br/), a Brazilian construction equipment rental company. I helped train and build infrastructure for a CV model used to identify damage in construction machinery.

In my freshman year I was an international competitor at FSU's [Case Competition Club](https://www.linkedin.com/company/fsu-case-competition-club/about/). I represented FSU at the [Scotiabank International Case Competition](https://www.ivey-sicc.com/) hosted by [Ivey Business School](https://www.ivey.uwo.ca/), along with [Pedro](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pedromartinsaffonso/), [Bruno](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brunobdelnero/), and [Cole](https://www.linkedin.com/in/coleclemons/). 

### Broadly

My favorite hobby is going on road trips and traveling in general. I've driven from Florida to California, as well as from Toronto to Maine. This year I've also traveled through Paris, the Netherlands, and Germany. I want to expand my passion for traveling to Africa and Asia this year - and I'm always open to suggestions!
