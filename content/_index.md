I have a strong technical background and a passion for digital safety and governance. I'm especially interested in tech policy, trust & safety, cybersecurity, digital infrastructure, privacy engineering, OSINT, artificial intelligence, and open source software.

My projects, research, and commentary have appeared in several outlets including the _New York Times_, the _Washington Post_, _NBC News_, _TIME_, _Foreign Affairs_, Brookings _TechStream_, and the _Nightly News_ with Lester Holt. I'm an undergraduate at Stanford.

Some of the projects I'm most proud of are [Atlos](https://atlos.org), [PrivacySpy](https://privacyspy.org), [Shynet](https://github.com/milesmcc/shynet), [PolitiTweet](https://polititweet.org), my work at the [Stanford Internet Observatory](https://io.stanford.edu), and [a17t](https://a17t.miles.land). I teach [CS 106S](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs106s/) at Stanford, I worked on cyber policy for a [2020 presidential campaign](/portfolio/politics), I'm a non-resident undergraduate fellow at the Cornell [Tech Policy Lab](https://tpl.as.cornell.edu), I'm an alum of the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/scout/click?t=e62336f0f378bcf03a96d441d015db88), and I've done some [research](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lrKeJiUAAAAJ).

And finally, for the obligatory apostrophe soup: PA &rsquo;19, [RC S1 &rsquo;20](https://www.recurse.com/scout/click?t=e62336f0f378bcf03a96d441d015db88), [Stanford &rsquo;24](https://stanford.edu/~mccain/). More details are in my [portfolio](/portfolio/).

### Currently

I'm in my junior year at Stanford. I'm working primarily on [Atlos](https://atlos.org), as well as part time at [CISA](https://cisa.gov/). Some other things are happening, too.
