gchat is a real-time chat platform. It uses [gauth](https://github.com/GabrielBarros36/gauth), my (non-prod!) auth library.
- Access the source code [here](https://github.com/GabrielBarros36/gchat)
- Use it [here](https://www.gchat.cloud/)

Its backend is written in Rust, with:
- Tokio for async support
- Axum for all API endpoints
- Websockets for all live chat functionalities
- Postgres for user management and message storage
- Next.js for frontend, hosted in Vercel
- DigitalOcean as a VPS
