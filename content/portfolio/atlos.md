[Atlos](https://atlos.org) is a platform for open source visual investigations. It helps journalists, human rights organizations, and OSINT investigators collaborate at scale.

Atlos isn't just a prototype: it already powers Bellingcat's pioneering investigatory work in Ukraine, through their Global Authentication Project.

Giancarlo Fiorella, an investigator at Bellingcat, called Atlos a "game changer."
